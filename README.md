# Solana Raydium Volume Bot

The Solana Raydium Volume Bot is a sophisticated open-source tool designed to efficiently facilitate high-volume transactions on the Solana blockchain. This script is ideal for users seeking to streamline complex transaction processes while maximizing performance.

## Initial Setup

To successfully set up and activate the Solana Volume Bot, please adhere to the following procedures.

### Step 1: Preparation

#### a) Dependency Installation

Execute the command below to install all required dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```

#### b) Environment Configuration

Modify the `.env` file to specify necessary credentials:

- **Wallet Private Key:** This key must be configured to handle Jito tips and manage SOL/WSOL transfers.
- **RPC URL:** Specify the RPC endpoint for Solana ecosystem
  .

#### c) Launch the Script

Run the script using:

```bash
node main.js
```

### Step 2: Execution Workflow

**Note:** Ensure procedures are followed sequentially, and avoid generating new keypairs unless reclaiming SOL.

#### a) Keypair Generation

Generate new keypairs for transaction operations to maintain fresh and distinct addresses.

#### b) SOL/WSOL Allocation

Evenly distribute SOL/WSOL across keypairs for transaction gas fees. The recommended gas provision ranges from 0.05 to 1 SOL. Set a specific volume for each keypair to process transactions seamlessly.

#### c) Volume Simulation

Conduct a simulation to calculate Jito tip fees and Raydium 5bps charges, allowing you to understand the complete cost associated with achieving target volumes.

#### d) Execute Volume Transactions

Activate the volume bot to carry out desired transaction volumes. Implement time intervals between swaps, ideally between 3-10 seconds, to maintain transaction authenticity.

#### e) Fund Recovery

Retrieve remaining funds from the keypairs, consolidating WSOL and SOL back to the configured wallet.
